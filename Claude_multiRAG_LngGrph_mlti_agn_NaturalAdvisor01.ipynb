Effective management involves a combination of evidence-based pharmacological treatments and supportive non-pharmacological strategies. This report synthesizes the current scientific understanding, explores traditional natural approaches, and offers comprehensive recommendations for managing eczema. It emphasizes safety considerations, lifestyle integration, and the importance of professional medical care, with a clear disclaimer on consulting healthcare professionals for personalized advice.\n",

For severe cases, systemic medications may be necessary. Patient education on treatment application and skin care routines plays a critical role in effective management. Recent studies support a tailored, proactive approach to treatment, focusing on individual patient needs and long-term management strategies.\n",

            "- **Physical Therapies:** Applying techniques such as acupuncture to decrease stress and potentially improve skin health.\n",
